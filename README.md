## Problem Statement

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price

### Business Goal

Required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

## Steps involved:
- Data understanding and exploration
- Data cleaning
- Data preparation
- Model building and evaluation
- Observation and inference

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions

On the evaluation, the r2_value for Lasso regression was better compared to Ridge regression. Also Lasso regression eliminates the variables that doesnâ€™t contribute for model prediction by making the coefficients to zero to get better r2_value.
